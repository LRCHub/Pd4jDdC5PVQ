# Thousand Foot Krutch – Everyone Like Me

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
I've got a lot going on inside
Don't know if I can work things out this time
Need a little space to clear my mind
But I'll be fine
Don't slip, it's not always this cold
I'm tired of acting like I know
Am I searching for the answers
No one knows
And I must confess
Before I take another step
That
This song's for everyone like me
Everyone not afraid to stand alone
And lonely
Can you identify with me?
This song's for everyone like you
Come and ride with me
We will not back down
Wait
It might not be too late
To avoid the tension we create
How about I turn and walk away?
No matter what you say
Its not a combination
I've tried to figure you out
I'm looking for the confirmation
So I can turn this around
And I must confess
Before I take another step
That
This song's for everyone like me
Everyone not afraid to stand alone
And lonely
Can you identify with me?
This song's for everyone like you
Come and ride with me
We will not back down
Every time I turn around
You're looking for attention
You've taken all the things I've said and
Throw them away
Drank them away
Every time you show up late
You're looking for forgiveness
I must confess
Before I take another step
That
This song's for anyone whoever took a chance,
Who started at the bottom to get to the top,
And no matter what you face in this life,
You gotta know what you're up against,
In order to fight back
This song's for everyone like me
Everyone not afraid to stand alone
And lonely
Can you identify with me?
This song's for everyone like you
Come and ride with me
We will not back down
This song's for everyone like me
Everyone not afraid to stand alone
And lonely
And lonely
